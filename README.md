## Adaptive Resonance Theory

Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is, loosely, a style and family of neural network models pioneered by Stephen Grossberg. You can read all about it in his magnum opus paper [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71bc/18bcafe1f4909a97b0b17a522dffe306ee6a.pdf) (I dare you).

ART models are primarily motivated by modeling human phenomenology and experimental neuroscience. As such, they fall under the auspices of computational neuroscience rather than traditional machine learning.

This project is meant to be a package of ART model implementations in Python with an aim toward using and exploring them in contemporary AI-driven applications.
